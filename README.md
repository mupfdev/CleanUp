# CleanUp

## About

CleanUp is a MS-DOS game written by [Ertugrul "Freak"
SÃ¶ylemez](https://github.com/esoeylemez) and Kemal "SHOOTER" Urgancioglu
back in March 2000.  It was developed in one night.

Now, 20 years later, it has been rediscovered, and with Kemal's
permission, I hereby release it under the terms of BSD-3-clause licence.
See the file [LICENCE.md](LICENCE.md) for details.

Ertugrul suddenly passed away on May 12th, 2018.  May [the
Funk](https://mightyboosh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Funk) watch over you.

## Future

I want to port this game to SDL2 in the long run.  I have not yet
evaluated the necessary effort.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to Chris for saving it all these years.
